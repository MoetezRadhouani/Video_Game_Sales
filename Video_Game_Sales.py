#  I am particularly interested in exploring how the sales of these top 10 selling games are distributed across various regions.So, let's delve into the realm of visualizations and unlock the fascinating story behind the regional sales distribution of these gaming juggernauts!
#  How much this top selling games be attributed to the North American market? The European market? The Japanese market? We can answer this question by building a Stacked Bar Chart.

# In[38]:


#extract our x and four y variables (sales from each region) from our top_ten video games
x = top_ten['Name']
y1 = top_ten["NA_Sales"]
y2 = top_ten["EU_Sales"]

# In terms of regional sales distribution:
#  it is evident that <b> Tetris </b> and <b> Duck Hunt </b> have found their stronghold primarily in the North American market. Conversely, the Japanese market exhibits a significant affinity for  <b> Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue </b> , accounting for a relatively larger share of its sales. Interestingly, the European market appears to show less enthusiasm for <b> Super Mario Bros. and Tetris </b> , as these titles have performed relatively poorly compared to other regions. These observations highlight the varying preferences and reception of games across different regions, showcasing the intricate dynamics of the global gaming landscape.

# ## Year 

# Indeed, the previous exploration was quite enjoyable, but now it's time to shift our focus to the next variable in line: the Year variable. With a time-series variable at our disposal, we have an array of possibilities to delve into. However, let's refrain from getting carried away just yet. The Year variable holds immense potential for unraveling trends and patterns, and we'll undoubtedly have an exciting journey ahead as we explore its insights. So, without further ado, let's begin our exploration of this fascinating variable while ensuring we maintain a steady pace.

# After a careful examination of the dataset, a distinct pattern emerges regarding the number of games published over time. It becomes evident that there was a notable peak in game releases around the years <b> 2008-2009 </b> . However, subsequent to this peak, a significant decline in the number of game releases is observed. While the precise reasons underlying this phenomenon may vary, it gives the impression that the gaming industry is currently experiencing a downturn.

# Surprisingly, the "Other" category, which includes smaller publishers, emerged as the leading publisher in the video game industry without any doubt. This reveals that there are numerous small publishers that collectively contribute to the vast selection of games available. <b> Electronic Arts, Activision, and Namco Bandai Games </b> secured the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th positions, respectively. <b> Nintendo </b> , despite having the most successful games in the top ten best-selling list, surprisingly ranked <b> 7th </b> with a total of 696 games.

# # Regional Sales over Time

# We now have the breakdown of sales for the NA, EU, JP, and Other regions. . Our goal is to identify any trends in sales over time in these four markets.
# To achieve this, we'll start by constructing a dataframe. This dataframe will be created by combining four series, where each series represents the sales of one region over time.

# We have the opportunity to analyze the growth of the gaming industry in various regions. The data reveals an interesting trend: the Japanese market experienced an early surge, surpassing the European market in the earlier years. However, due to potential limitations in market size, the European market eventually outpaced the Japanese market around 1997. Additionally, the global market (Other_Sales) started gaining momentum around 2000.

Sony and Electronic Arts entered the scene around 1995, but Sony's sales trajectory reached its peak during its initial phase. On the other hand, Activision and Take-Two Interactive experienced significant growth in more recent years, marking their rise in the industry.

# We observe distinct fluctuations in the sales trends for different gaming platforms. The initial generation of PlayStation marked a significant milestone in the industry, exhibiting outstanding sales. However, with the successive release of newer generations (PS2, PS3, and PS4), sales swiftly transitioned towards these updated versions. Notably, the performance of PS3 and PS4 exhibited weaknesses and experienced a decline, particularly when compared to the success of the first two generations. This decline could potentially indicate that PlayStation is gradually losing its prominence in the market. Additionally, between 2005 and 2010, we witness a surge in the popularity of other platforms such as Wii, DS, and X360.

# We can now visualize the regions that deviate from the norm in terms of genre preferences. Specifically, for the Role-Playing, Strategy, Puzzle, and Adventure genres, the Japanese market shows a comparatively higher level of interest. However, for Shooter and Racing genres, the Japanese market displays a lower level of interest. On the other hand, the North American region exhibits a significantly larger proportion of interest in the Shooter genre, but a lower proportion for Role-Playing and Strategy genres. The proportions in the European Union (EU) remain relatively consistent, accounting for approximately 20-30% of sales across all genres.

# Video games provide a safe environment for enhancing our soft skills and honing our abilities. Certain games pose significant challenges, encouraging mastery. Nonetheless, these same games also offer beginners positive reinforcement for their small achievements, emphasizing the importance of finding joy in life's little moments, which may eventually reveal themselves to be significant.
